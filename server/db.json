MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of&nbsp;<em>Family Guy</em>&nbsp;had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_You_Wish_Upon_a_Weinstein\" target=\"_blank\">one episode</a>&nbsp;left unaired.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Swim\" target=\"_blank\">Adult Swim</a>&nbsp;aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings\" target=\"_blank\">ratings</a>&nbsp;for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.</p><p>Since its debut on January 31, 1999,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Family_Guy_episodes\" target=\"_blank\">319 episodes</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Family Guy</em>&nbsp;have been broadcast.

      "body": "<p>King's new novel, about a writer held hostage by his self-proclaimed \"\"number-one fan,'' is unadulteratedly terrifying. Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death. Sheldon has killed off Misery Chastain, the popular protagonist of his Misery series and Annie, who has a murderous past, wants her back. Keeping the paralyzed Sheldon prisoner, she forces him to revive the character in a continuation of the series, and she reads each page as it comes out of the typewriter; there is a joyously Dickensian novel within a novel here, and it appears in faded typescript. Studded among the frightening moments are sparkling reflections on the writer and his audience, on the difficulties, joys and responsibilities of being a storyteller, on the nature of the muse, on the differences between ``serious'' and ``popular'' writing. Sheldon is a revealingly autobiographical figure; Annie is not merely a monster but is subtly and often touchingly portrayed, allowing hostage and keeper a believable, if twisted, relationship. The best parts of this novel demand that we take King seriously as a writer with a deeply felt understanding of human psychology. One million first printing; $400,000 ad/promo; BOMC main selection.

In contemporary times, schoolteacher John Pentecost returns from Suffolk to his family’s Endlands farm with his wife, Kat, to attend the funeral of his grandfather and announce the impending birth of their first child. Almost immediately, they step into a mire of ominous portents: someone recently set fire to the nearby forest, animals are being killed, <em>disembodied voices are heard on the moors, and one of the resi</em>dents is mysteriously missing. <strong>Matters come</strong> to a head on Devil’s Day, celebrated before the annual gathering of the sheep, when the locals ritually give the devil his due and the border between superstitions and genuinely uncanny events wears perilously thin. Hurley keeps the explanations for what occurs deliciously ambiguous, filtering discoveries through John, who, as he selectively relates past memories to present happenings, reveals himself to be a less-than-forthcoming narrator at best. The result is an intensely suspenseful tale memorable for what it says about unshakable traditions that are bred in the bone.</p>",

Winge enlists the aid of Mickel Cardell, a veteran of a fruitless war with Russia in which he lost an arm. Now working as a watchman, Mickel retrieved the cadaver from the water. The pair have few clues to work with, but a piece of fabric with unusual markings wrapped around the body leads them to the Eumenides, an ostensibly charitable upper-class organization that meets in a building that houses a bordello. The book’s structure, which includes flashbacks and multiple perspectives, will remind many of Iain Pears’s&nbsp;<em>An Instance of the Fingerpost</em>, and Natt och Dag uses this structure to heighten suspense and deepen characterizations.

The key feature of middleware is that it is composable. Multiple middleware can be combined together, where each middleware requires no knowledge of what comes before or after it in the chain.</p><p>The most common use case for middleware is to support asynchronous actions without much boilerplate code or a dependency on a library like&nbsp;Rx. It does so by letting you dispatch&nbsp;async actions&nbsp;in addition to normal actions.</p><p>For example,&nbsp;redux-thunk&nbsp;lets the action creators invert control by dispatching functions. They would receive&nbsp;dispatch&nbsp;as an argument and may call it asynchronously. Such functions are called&nbsp;<em>thunks</em>. Another example of middleware is&nbsp;redux-promise. It lets you dispatch a&nbsp;Promise&nbsp;async action, and dispatches a normal action when the Promise resolves.</p><p>Middleware is not baked into&nbsp;createStore&nbsp;and is not a fundamental part of the Redux architecture, but we consider it useful enough to be supported right in the core. This way, there is a single standard way to extend&nbsp;dispatch&nbsp;in the ecosystem, and different middleware may compete in expressiveness and utility.</p>",

You&nbsp;don't need a leg press machine, or a stair climber, or a squat bar to fire up those lower-body muscles. All you need is your bodyweight, maybe a chair, and the motivation to put some&nbsp;burn&nbsp;in your quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves, and inner thighs. Oh, and this list of 13 no-equipment leg exercises that you can do anywhere, anytime.</p><p><br></p><p>It probably comes as no surprise that having&nbsp;strong legs&nbsp;can take you far. Even if you're not&nbsp;training for a race&nbsp;or working toward any other specific athletic goal, you need legs that are strong enough to literally carry you through life. Everything from walking up a flight of stairs to lifting your heavy laundry bag is easier when you can put some leg muscle behind it. Luckily, effective leg exercises don't have to be complicated, and they don't even require a gym membership. There are plenty of bodyweight leg exercises you can add to your workout routine to get stronger—and work toward any bigger strength and performance goals you may have, too.</p><p>\"Bodyweight exercises are realistic and functional, meaning that they help us strengthen our muscles that we use in our daily lives,\"&nbsp;Jess Sims, a NASM-certified personal trainer at the Fhitting Room and Shadowbox in New York City, tells SELF. \"For example, when we squat, we are essentially sitting down into an imaginary chair, which will help improve our posture when we actually sit in a chair. When we stand up from a squat, we drive through our heels and brace our core—we are essentially building great habits that translate into our lives outside the gym.\"</p><p>Bodyweight leg exercises are also valuable for learning proper form before you add weights to certain moves. \"We shouldn’t be using weights until we’ve mastered&nbsp;basic lunge, hinge, and&nbsp;squatmovements without weights,\" Sims says. Another bonus of bodyweight moves? \"You have your body all the time and it’s free to use, so you can do exercises anywhere and at anytime!\" The best leg workouts are the ones you'll actually do, right? So if you've got an arsenal of moves that you can literally do anywhere, there's a better chance you'll fit them into your routine</p>",
